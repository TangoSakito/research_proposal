\section{Research Question}
This proposal aims to answer the following questions: Do mothers work more if they have better access to childcare services? 
In other words, how large is the treatment effect of childcare services on mothers' labor supply?
To estimate, I suggest using the introduction of optional separate surnames as a natural experiment, which has not been introduced in Japan yet.
The estimation design I use is the randomized assignment with incomplete compliance; the announcement of the introduction of optional separate surnames is the random assignment of treatment, the use of childcare service is the take-up of treatment, and mothers' labor supply is the outcome.


The remainder of this proposal is organized as follows. 
Section 2 provides the motivation for this proposal. 
Section 3 explains the potential institutional background of optional separate surnames which I assume in this proposal.
Section 4 formulates the empirical model and explains why the identification strategy is valid.
Section 5 describes the data I use in this proposal.


\section{Motivation}
The relationship between fertility and mothers' labor supply is one of the major topics in Japan. 
According to the Japanese National Fertility Survey, conducted in 2021 by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, about 41\%  of full-time working mothers stop working full-time after the birth of their first child.
It is important to provide an environment where mothers can work while raising children to promote the full use of labor resources, female social advancement, and fertility rate.


In this context, the effectiveness of childcare services is a key issue. 
Expanding childcare services is expected to reduce mothers' burden of child-rearing and increase their labor supply.
In fact, the supply of childcare services has been increasing, according to the Children and Families Agency. 
However, increasing its supply requires a large budget, so evaluating its effectiveness is integral.


A wide range of studies estimate the effect of childcare services on mothers' labor supply.
\cite{Baker2008-vt} is one of the most famous studies. 
They use the introduction of childcare services in Quebec, Canada, and show that the policy increased mothers' labor supply.
However, existing studies show mixed results and one difficulty in estimating the effect is the endogeneity problem.
Mothers who want to work more are likely to be more enthusiastic about applying for childcare services.
Also, it is the government that decides the supply of childcare services. 
The government which increases the supply of childcare services is more likely to implement other policies promoting mothers' labor supply.
If we ignore these endogeneities, the estimated effect of childcare services could be overestimated.


This paper suggests using the introduction of optional separate surnames as an instrument to deal with the endogeneity problem and estimate the treatment effect of childcare services on mothers' labor supply.
Today, Japan does not allow married couples to have separate surnames.
However, the discussion on the introduction of optional separate surnames is spreading.
A survey by NHK in April 2024 reveals that 62\% of Japanese people support the introduction of optional separate surnames while 27\% oppose it (\cite{nhk}).
Although the political process of introducing optional separate surnames is still uncertain, given current public opinion, the probability of its introduction in the coming years is not low.


Suppose the introduction is decided and announced in Japan, but the implementation is scheduled for next year.
Then, couples who want to have separate surnames may postpone their marriage until the implementation. 
It is plausible because it is very costly to marry before the implementation, share the same surname, and change it after the implementation, compared to just marrying after the implementation.
Also, if marriage is postponed, the birth of children is likely to be postponed.
Therefore, the number of pregnancies could decline between the announcement and the implementation.
As a result, children whose parents get pregnant just before the announcement are expected to have fewer coetaneous children.


This reduction of coetaneous children leads to an exogenous decline in demand for childcare services.
Hence, mothers who have children just before the announcement have better access to childcare services due to the exogenous slack of demand.
Using this exogenous variation, we can estimate the effect of childcare services on mothers' labor supply. 


Of course, there is no study which uses the introduction of optional separate surnames in Japan as an instrument.
This proposal potentially has a significant contribution to the literature.
Therefore, it is valuable to design the empirical strategy in advance and prepare for the implementation.


\section{Potential Institutional Background}
In this proposal, I assume that the optional separate surnames policy is implemented as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The policy is announced at some point. 
  \item A year later, the policy is implemented.
  \item All couples can choose whether to have separate surnames or not after the implementation.
\end{itemize}
The important point is that there exists a lag between the announcement and the implementation.
Due to this lag, some couples who want to have separate surnames may postpone their marriage until the implementation, which could delay the birth of their children.
It is plausible to expect that there exists a lag because allowing separate surnames requires a wide range of administrative changes.
In this proposal, I assume the lag to be twelve months, but the actual lag could be longer or shorter if it exists.

For simplicity, dismiss the variation in the durations of pregnancy across mothers. 
Also, suppose the lag is one year between the announcement and the implementation.
I denote a fiscal year as year $T$ if a mother who gets pregnant her first child just before the announcement gives birth in that fiscal year.
I also denote a year before year $T$ as year $T-1$, and a year after year $T$ as year $T+1$, and so on.


Then, See the mothers whose first child is born in year $T-1$. 
All of these mothers are pregnant ``before'' the announcement, so all of them are not affected by the announcement.
Also, see the mothers whose first child is born in year $T$. 
Then, mothers whose first child is born in the first some months (denote as $h$ months) are pregnant ``before'' the announcement, and the others are pregnant ``after'' the announcement.
As a result, due to the postponement of marriage and pregnancy I explained above, the number of first children born in year $T$ is expected to be smaller than that in year $T-1$.


Based on the argument above, I classify the mothers whose first child is born in the first $h$ months in year $T$ as treatment group, and the mothers whose first child is born in the first $h$ months in year $T-1$ as control group (see Figure \ref{fig:timeline}).
Then, it is plausible to expect that the distribution of predetermined characteristics of mothers is identical between the treatment and control groups.
Both do not know the policy when deciding pregnancy and their childbirths differ only by a year.
The only difference is the number of coetaneous children\footnote{we can partially test this by balancing test.}. 
Compared to the control group, the treatment group has fewer coetaneous children due to the postponement of marriage and pregnancy.
This reduction in the coetaneous children leads to better access to childcare service. 
Mothers in the treatment group have better access to childcare service because of the smaller demand and plenty of vacancy. 
Therefore, mothers in the treatment group can be regarded as randomly assigned to the treatment, which assigns childcare service with imperfect compliance\footnote{Mothers are not forced to use childcare service, so compliance is incomplete.}.


Note that the control group is restricted to the first $h$ months in year $T-1$, not the whole year.
This is because of the seasonality of childbirth: the characteristics of mothers differ by the season of childbirth\cite{Buckles2013-tj}. 
To eliminate the effect of seasonality, I restrict the sample to the first $h$ months in year $T-1$ and year $T$.

\subsection*{Regression Formulation}
Let $Y_i^s$ be the working hour of mother $i$ when her first child $s$ years old.
$Y_i^s$ can be other variable which represents mothers' labor supply: the labor force participation, the earnings, and so on.
Also, let $D_i^s$ be the indicator of whether mother $i$ uses childcare service. 
Then, the causal relationship of interest is 
\begin{equation}
  Y_i^s = \alpha + \beta D_i^s + \vb{X}_i'\vb{\gamma} + \epsilon_i, \label{step2}
\end{equation}
where $\vb{X}_i$ is the vector of predetermined characteristics of mother $i$, such as education, birthmonth of child, husband's income, and so on.
$s$ can be 1, 2, 3, and so on.


In the equation \eqref{step2}, $\beta$ is the treatment effect of childcare service on mothers' labor supply.
However, na\"ive OLS returns the biased estimate of $\beta$ because mothers who use childcare service are likely to be more enthusiastic about working.
To deal with this endogeneity, I formulate the first stage estimation as follows:
\begin{equation}
  D_i^s = \varphi + \pi Z_i + \vb{X}_i'\vb{\delta} + \eta_i, \label{step1}
\end{equation}
where $Z_i$ is the indicator of whether mother $i$ is in the treatment group.
By estimating \eqref{step 2} and \eqref{step 1} by 2SLS, we can obtain the unbiased and consistent estimate of $\beta$. 

\subsection*{Validation of Identification Strategy}
In this subsection, I validate the instrumental variable $Z_i$.
First, relevance is expected to hold, i.e., $Z_i$ is correlated with $D_i^s$ strongly enough. 
As \cite{nhk} shows, a large fraction of Japanese people support the introduction of optional separate surnames, and the fraction is larger in the younger generation.
In addition, the cost of choosing separate surnames is lower for couples who marry after the implementation than for those who marry before the implementation and already share the same surname.
Therefore, it is plausible to expect that the number of those choosing separate surnames and postponing marriage is not small, so the effect on the number of coetaneous children is significant


Second, the exclusion restriction is expected to hold, i.e., $Z_i$ affects $Y_i^s$ only through $D_i^s$.
As explained above, the distribution of predetermined characteristics of mothers is identical between the treatment and control groups, both observable and unobservable.
Therefore, whether mother $i$ is assigned to the treatment group or the control group does not affect $Y_i^s$ except through $D_i^s$.
Only one possibility of violation of the exclusion restriction is the difference in the timing of announcement. 
For mothers in the treatment group, the announcement is made when they are pregnant, while for mothers in the control group, the announcement is made when they are not pregnant.
If this difference affects mothers' labor supply directly, the exclusion restriction is violated.
However, I expect this is unlikely because the announcement is not directly related to mothers' labor supply.
It is not likely that the only one year difference in the timing of announcement affects mothers' labor supply.
